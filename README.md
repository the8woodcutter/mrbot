## mrBot: slixmpp bot made specifically for cmdr_chunk aka chunk aka chunkimo aka cmdr_coconut aka cmdr_melon on XMPP chats
### mrBot is intellectual property of chunk aka The Woodcutter.  This code belongs to The Woodcutter and Licence is to be decided.  You can help to build mrBot but not to take mrBot's likeness as that is chunk's own dog (character in xmpp as a bot) and chunk's private larp.  You simply cannot replicate chunk or chunkisms.

#### `TODO:`
* **Help information output** - SUCCESS!
* **About function describing mrBot** - DO RIGHT AWAY!
* **Refactor code to use more functions for typing less**
* Network functions like `host {ipaddress}`, `dig @9.9.9.9 {ipaddress} {record_type}`, `ping -c8 {ipaddress}` and pipe the terminal...
	...output as line by line output to chat for realism
* Refactor project so that functions exist as exterior class files
	* This involves creating classes with **methods** as they'll be used as methods in the main script
	* Consider saving extensive variables to a library class
* Find a use for an API
* Create a quote function using **exterior class file**
